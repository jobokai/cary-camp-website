# Branding Guidelines

These are branding guidelines from Boy Scouts of America and should be used for digital resources for web. Websites should be fully mobile friendly and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.


## Tone and Voice

“A Scout is trustworthy….” With this phrase,
millions of Scouts over the decades have begun
their oath. “Friendly, courteous ...”

These are powerful words that govern the way we speak when we speak for Scouting—and
whether we like it or not, when we speak, we do speak for all Scouting, especially in today’s internetenabled world.

• Be direct. Web readers tend to be task-oriented—they are looking for specific information,
and they want it quickly. Use active, not passive, voice.

• Be succinct. Attention spans are shorter online. Use short paragraphs of no more than
three–five sentences. Keep word counts to 250 words per page or less.

• K.I.S.S. Acronyms and technical terms may be second-nature to you, but a new Scout or
prospective parent won’t necessarily understand insider language. Keep it simple, Scout.

• Write for “scanners.” People tend to scan digital screens, rather than pore over every
word. Use bulleted lists, short headlines, and relevant imagery to provide quick entry
points to content.

## Layout and design

The iconic BSA look and feel is created
with distinctive type, inspired color, and
great imagery. Some general guidelines:
1. Start with a grid. This will create a clean, orderly look and feel for your
project. Use the same grid on all pages. six-column grid

2. Write great content. Set your content using only BSA-approved typefaces.
Refrain from using too many text sizes (three or four should be sufficient). In
general, the larger the typeface is, the more important that content is.

3. Use great imagery. The theme can be set with an inspirational “hero” image,
most likely from the “Living” guidelines so as not to distract from the
content, and treated with the standard or diagonal overlay (see next page).
Support the mood with related textures that follow the “Being” guidelines.
Use active “Doing” images within the page content.

4. Use plenty of whitespace. Give your content and images some breathing
room — there’s a reason art galleries have white walls.

5. Use color to enhance the content. Choose the appropriate color palette (Cub
Scouting palette is being used in the example). Use the accent color with
restraint so it retains its power of attraction.

The Overlay Effect
Type, color, and photography come together
within our signature overlay treatment, used
wherever type and images need to be joined,
as in website or email headers.

The overlay color is determined by the brand color palette being used. In this case, a
BSA Pale Blue is being used for a BSA-branded project. It can cover the entire image or
just a portion of the image. 

The accent stripe (used when a portion of the image is overlaid)
is also determined by the brand color palette being used. In this
case, a BSA Red is being used for a BSA-branded project.

The base image can be black and white or color.


## Diagonal

Inspired by the distinctive angled pockets
on the front of BSA uniforms, the diagonal
overlay offers a more dynamic, active take
on the overlay treatment. Color of the
overlay is inherited from the brand being
worked with. In these examples, the BSA
corporate palette is in use.

Diagonal is 72 degrees can be vertical descending or ascending, horizontal should open right

## Typography

Main Sections
Use the primary font at large sizes (36–48px) for
main sections of the page (H1, H2). Use all caps for
further emphasis, if necessary. Keep the text as short
as possible — just a few words should be enough.

Secondary Items
Use the primary or secondary font at medium sizes
(24–32px) for items within a section (H3). Titles can be a
word or two longer, and should be descriptive. Avoid
all-caps treatments. When relevant, use imperatives such
as “Sign Up for Xxxx” or “Camp at Xxxx This Summer.”

Body Text
Use the tertiary font at small sizes (9–12px) for body
copy (p). Remember to use plain, everyday language,
short paragraphs, and lots of bulleted lists to make the
text scannable and easy to read.

Primary
Use wherever type size is
greater than or equal to
16 px.

Secondary
Use sparingly in headings or
wherever special attention
is required. A little goes a
long way.

Tertiarty 
Use for long blocks of copy
smaller than 12 px.

Don't Add unnecessary effects to type or stetch, warp or distort fonts

### Typefaces
Primary - Roboto Slab Family, Trebuchet MS
Secondary - Roboto Condensed Family, Arial Black
Tertiary - Roboto condensed Family, Arial Regular

## Photography

Textural images can be used to tell a deeper, more
multisensory story — the deeply textured end of
a log you can almost touch. The smell of freshly
oiled leather or fresh rain on a field of hay can be
recalled by a deceptively simple image.
